## Inferred Annos Counter

This simple Java application is a utility for counting how many annotations
in a project are inferred when running Checker Framework whole-program inference
in .ajava mode. The utility works using a diff-based algorithm: as input,
it takes a single original annotated source file (e.g., `Foo.java`) and one or more corresponding
.ajava files produced by checkers for WPI 
(e.g., `Foo-org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.NullnessChecker.ajava`).
The files should be provided only after running both the original source file
and the .ajava files through a unified formatter, such as Google Java Format,
to remove formatting differences.

Run the Inferred Annos Counter using the `run-iac.sh` script in this directory.
The script takes two parameters:
1. the absolute path to a source tree of Java files
2. the absolute path to the source tree of ajava files generated by WPI and associated with item 2.

For example, to invoke the Inferred Annos Counter on the copy of `require-javadoc` in the inputExamples
folder, I would use the following command:
```
bash run.sh /Users/mjk76/Research/wpi/wpi-paper/experiments/inferred-annos-counter/inputExamples/require-javadoc/human-written /Users/mjk76/Research/wpi/wpi-paper/experiments/inferred-annos-counter/inputExamples/require-javadoc/generated
```

It produces a list, separated by file, of the annotations in each Java file and how many of them are found in
at least one of the given ajava files (in the same position). This utility only considers annotations to
be equal if they have the exact same arguments: it does not consider subtyping.

TODO: rewrite using the CF in a way that allows us to consider subtyping?
