# This script runs wpi.sh on projects that contain multiple  
# sub projects under their respective directories within your project.

# You must make the following changes:
# 1. Add the name of each subproject directory to the `SUBPROJECTS` array. 
# 2. Change WPITEMPDIR to "$1" and WPIOUTDIR to "$2" in your copy 
#    of the wpi-template.sh script.
# 3. Set -Ajava=${env.WPITEMPDIR} in the pom.xml.
# 4. Run this script using the `source` command.

# Other changes (to this script, the wpi.sh script, the project's 
# build system, or any combination of the former) may also 
# be required, to account for project-specific complexity.


# This variable is where the WPI Project root directory will be made and will store the entire project output (PROJECT_TEMP_ROOT).
